Capstone Project

# Definition Statement 
I want to build an application that allows users to track and monitor students/
child's activities and improvements. This will serve as a comprehensive platform for parents and teachers to communicate, fostering a supportive educational environment. The teachers will be able to track each class/student and their activities. 

# Audience 
My audience will be Teachers, Parents, Students and Administration.

# Contents of the Application 
### What do i want on each page?
I would like to have pictures/images of students working in classrooms to appear on the Home page. I would like to have a link/button on bottom of home to go back to top of page. I would like to also options on boy or girl logos when choosing students for classrooms, same with teacher and parents. I want each page to be easy to navigate even for parents who may not speak or understand English the best, so that they can be more involved and not intimidated or overwhelmed by the application. 

### What do i want the functionality of each page to be?
I want the functionality to be easy to navigate, making it accessible for both tech-savvy individuals and those less familiar with technology, and simple while being informative. 

### What is the purpose of my application?
My application will provide teachers with a tracking system of their classrooms and their students progress. My app. will also allow for parents who may not be able to come into schools in person to be able to ask questions and communicate with teacher. This will help Students get the support they need for learning and growing. Keeps everyone involved on the same page. "ON TRACK" 

### What business problem or real world problem am i going to be solving? 
My application will be and easy and effective communication and tracking tool for everyone involved. This will solve problems of a child being left behind in bigger classroom settings or slipping threw the cracks. Both Teacher and Parent can call attention to problem areas and help child thrive.
